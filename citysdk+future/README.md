## CitySDK + future

An API for the distribution and annotation of open data, for small cities and big metropolitan areas. With the CitySDK Linked Data API, a city has a simple-to-use interface to all its data â€” it makes city services easier to implement, data easier to distribute, and applications easier to build, and works for both real-time and static data sets.
